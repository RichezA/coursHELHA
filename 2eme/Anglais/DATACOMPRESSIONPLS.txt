Data compression in cloud computing:

This is a useful technique that helps reducing the data but still storing
the same amount of data in fewer bits resulting in a reduction of the data
storage space, resource usage or transmission capacity.

There's two types of data compression:

Lossless (mainly used for multimedia): The compression reduces bits by 
identifying and eliminating stastistical redundancy. There's no lose of 
information.

Lossy: This compression system reduces bits by removing unnecessary or less 
important information.

It is also called, in the context of data transmission as source coding.
